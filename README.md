## Backend Integration

For advanced **AI-powered summarization**, LexiHelp connects to a backend powered by **FastAPI**, supporting both quick extractive and smart abstractive summarization methods.

### Available Endpoints

- `POST /api/summarize/extract`  
  Fast extractive summarization using **TextRank** (via pyTextRank).

- `POST /api/summarize/abstract`  
  Smart abstractive summarization powered by the **Cohere API**.

Ensure your backend server is running and configured properly in the extension settings.

### Setup Backend Server

Ensure you have Python installed, then follow these steps:

After clone this repository

```
cd backend
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:8000 by default.

> **Note:**  
> Don't forget to configure your `COHERE_API_KEY` in a `.env` file for the abstractive summarization to work properly.
